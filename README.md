## About this Project
This is a long running project to create an image albums management tool with decentralized database in a form of .json file, intended for my personal use. This project comes in two part; MetadataEditor and ViewerApp.

The first is MetadataEditor which is a desktop app used to generate a .json file from a folder of images, so it can be recognized by the ViewerApp.

The second is ViewerApp which is an Android App used to view and manage said image albums.
