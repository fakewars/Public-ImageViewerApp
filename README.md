## About this Project
This is a long running project to create an image albums management tool with decentralized database in a form of .json file, intended for my personal use. This project comes in two part, the main application is a web app built on .Net 5 API and ReactJs UI to view and manage a collection of "albums". While the other one is a desktop application to convert a folder of image and videos into an "album" than can be read by the main application.
